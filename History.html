The due process Clause, which is made up of the same eleven words and is found in the Fourteenth Amendment, that was established in 1868, outlines a requirement on all states. <br><br>When the Miranda v. Arizona case expanded the government is supposed to order to protect the rights in the fifth Amendment, it served as an example of the right due to process.

        “The United States Government would incarcerate about 120,000 Japanese Americans in “internment camps” without trial or any evidence of wrongdoing, because the government declared them to be a threat to the nation.” (1942)
