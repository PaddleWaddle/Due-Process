      <h3>The constitution states “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
        <br>
        <br>
        –US Constitution
        <br>
        <br>
        This means that a state can not make a law that violates the rights of citizens or make a law that takes away life liberty or property without a fair trial or  deny a person  the protection of the laws.

      <h3>The right to due process is complicated because someone can be found guilty even though they are innocent.<br>
        <br> It is also complicated because it is a very long process and sometimes can be traumatizing for a muder victim’s family and the person can still be found innocent.<br>
        <br> Rights are a power or a privilege that can be easily violated by the government, which is impenetrable.
